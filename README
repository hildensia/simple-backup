Simple Backup
=============

This is my personal very easy backup script. It uses hard-links to save space
and be able to make gradual backups. 

Configuration
-------------

Configuration is pretty easy. Just set the two variables at the beginning of the
backup.sh scipt. Since I use rsync every rsync compatible location can be used
(e.g. local folders, ssh locations etc.). Do yourself a favor and backup your
data not on the local machine.
